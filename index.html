  <h2>Regional History</h2>
  <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>Cyprus has been a meeting point for some of the greatest civilizations throughout history, including the Hittites, the Egyptians, the Persians, the Greeks, 
      and the Romans. It is also known as the mythological birthplace of the goddess Aphrodite, born from the foam of the sea. Due to its strategically important location, 
      Cyprus has been conquered by the different colonial powers of the Eastern Mediterranean. The earliest settlements in Cyprus appeared around 7000-6000 BCE during the 
      Neolithic era. The copper trade developed between 3900 and 2500 BCE, bringing wealth and prosperity to the island. This led to the development of the island as a leading 
      commercial center between the Near East and the West. The arrival of the Mycenaeans and the Achaeans brought culture, customs, and language alongside new cities. The 
      Greek city-states changed hands between the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Persians before Cyprus became a part of Egypt following the death of Alexander the Great. In the 
      Hellenistic period, culture and the arts flourished and Pafos became the capital. The island became a part of the Roman Empire in 58 BCE and was annexed by the Byzantine 
      Empire after the end of the Roman period in the 4th century CE. Christianity became the dominant religion during this time. Other groups would later take control of the 
      island, including the Franks, Venetians, Ottomans, the British, and most recently the Turks in Northern Cyprus.</blockquote>

  <h2>Regional Resources</h2>
  <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>Cyprus is the third largest island in the Eastern Basin of the Mediterranean Sea. It is dominated by two mountain ranges, the Troodos Mountains and the Kyrenia 
      Mountains. In antiquity, many different groups sought to control Cyprus due to its strategic location. Cyprus was rich in copper and the valuable ore was shipped across the 
      Mediterranean in the form of oxhide-shaped ingots. Timber, wine, textiles, corn, and medicinal plants were also important exports.</blockquote>

  <h2>Major Sites and Cultural Aspects</h2>

    <blockquote>  APHRODITE    Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore

  <h2>Introduction to Major Artifact Types (Polis)</h2>
  <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>From the cleaning done on the Excavations at Polis data set, the many various artifacts were slotted into 16 unique categories. Terracotta figurines are by 
      far the largest category, making up just over 30% of the total artifact count. These are common at Polis as the site was used for religious worship and figurines were 
      often brought as offerings to the gods. As Polis was also a metalworking site there is a substantial amount of slag, the waste matter separated during the process of 
      refining ore, present. In line with this, metals like bronze and iron are also present. Like many archaeological digs, pottery and numismatics are present throughout 
      the site. Organic material, bone, ivory, and shell also make up a substantial amount of the overall distribution. Architectural materials and mosaic tesserae are 
      common as well.</blockquote>
  </div>

  <h2>Archaological Ethics</h2>
  <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>Probably the most significant ethical issue related to Cypriot archaeology is the division of the island between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Cyprus 
      has been a divided island since 1974 when Turkey invaded to support Turkish Cypriots following a military coup backed by the Athens government. The island itself 
      has had two autonomous administrations since 1974, though there is no official partition. The UN has placed peacekeeping troops on the division between Turkish 
      and Greek Cyprus to prevent further violence. The political division makes it difficult if not impossible for archaeologists to study the north side of the island. 
      Unfortunately, looting is common in the Turkish Cyprus as well due to related rules and enforcement being lax. This is sadly a common issue within archaeology. When 
      an object is looted, data regarding both the artifacts and the context in which they were found is forever lost.</blockquote>

  <h2>Recommendations for the Archaeologically Inclined Visitor</h2>
  <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>Cyprus has an impressive historical legacy and has become famous for its archaeological sites and treasures. As a result, there are many places worth visiting. 
      Paphos is one of the most mesmerizing archaeological sites and is accessible to visitors. Founded in the late 4th century, Nea Pafos became the capital of the island during 
      the Hellenistic and Roman eras. Currently, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with vast remaining including four Roman villas, an odeon, an agora, an Asclepeion (healing 
      temple dedicated to Asclepius, and royal tombs. Another point of interest is the Greek city-state of Salamis. Previously a thriving port city, Salamis was first founded 
      following the Trojan War. It served as the main port and capital for a thousand years, and saw great wealth and influence until its near destruction from a series of 
      earthquakes in the late 4th century CE. Many of the existing ruins are from the Roman period and include a gymnasium, Roman baths, a theatre, and basilicas. A third site 
      to visit is Kourion, which sits atop a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean. It is the best-preserved Greco-Roman city of Southern Cyprus. Systematic excavations have shown  
      that the city became a major settle in after the Mycenaeans settled there in the 13th century BCE and became an important cultural and religious center with the nearby Sanctuary 
      of Apollo Ylatis. Like many coastal cities of the island, it was ruined by earthquakes in the 4th century BCE and was eventually completely abandoned until its rediscovery in 1820. 
      All of these sites will provide visitors with a fascinating glimpse at the storied history of Cyprus.</blockquote>
