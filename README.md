# Cypriot Archaeology Website
## Project Overview

This project is a website created from scratch with HTML and CSS designed to showcase Cypriot archaeology with a particular focus on the Polis Chrysochous archaeological site. 
As a cross-disciplinary effort, work was split between researching relevant topics and creating the website itself. In addition to the work on the website itself, a significant
amount of time was invested in the cleaning and visualization of the Excavations at Polis data set from the Open Context data website. The end result is a final project which combines  
web design, archaeological research, and data science.
