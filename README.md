# Cypriot Archaeology Website
## Project Overview

This website, created from scratch with HTML and CSS, was designed to showcase Cypriot archaeology with a particular focus on the Polis Chrysochous archaeological site. Topics, including introductions to the regional history of Cyprus, major cultural aspects, artifact types, and achaeological ethics, are supplemented with embedded resources like maps or recordings. Work done to clean and visualize the Excavations at Polis data set from the Open Context data website is presented on a page of the site. As a cross-disciplinary effort, time was split between researching relevant topics and creating the website itself. The end result combines web design, archaeological research, and data science.
