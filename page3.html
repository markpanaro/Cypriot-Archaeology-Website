  <h1>Visualizations of Polis Chrysochous Data</h1>

  <h2>From Open Context's Excavations at Polis Set</h2>
  
  <div class="text">
      <blockquote>This page contains visualizations and explanations of different sections of data from the Excavations at
      Polis data set obtained from Open Context. Decisions about where to excavate next are normally made by examining the 
      types of materials and artifacts found within a site based off a posed research question. These visualizations were made 
      to assist in making these choices. To download or view the original data set please click <a

    <blockquote>For this section regarding material type: An initial missing data clean is performed. From there, 
      many of the remaining data points are cleaned to present a more general view. For example, "Marble", "Marble 
      - White", and "Marble - Smooth White" were all combined to be a part of the "Marble" category for visualization. 
      Additionally, there is a large count of individual or groups of items not significant enough to graph. Any item 
      category that makes up less than 1% of the total dataset is marked as "Other" for visualization purposes. These 
      items would crowd the visualization, and are easier to make sense of as a list.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Within active archaeological digs, it can be useful to know where to dig next based on the research problem. 
      Visualizing the material distribution from different contexts can make it easier to know where to dig next.</blockquote>
