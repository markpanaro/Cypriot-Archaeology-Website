      <blockquote>For this section regarding material type: An initial missing data clean is performed. From there, 
        many of the remaining data points are cleaned to present a more general view. For example, "Marble", "Marble 
        - White", and "Marble - Smooth White" were all combined to be a part of the "Marble" category for visualization. 
        Additionally, there is a large count of individual or groups of items not significant enough to graph. Any item 
        category that makes up less than 1% of the total dataset is marked as "Other" for visualization purposes. These 
        items would crowd the visualization, and are easier to make sense of as a list.</blockquote>
