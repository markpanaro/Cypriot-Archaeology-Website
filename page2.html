    <blockquote>Paphos is a fascinating site which served as the capital of Cyprus during the Hellenistic and Roman eras. The House of Theseus is one 
    of four remaining Roman villas within the site. It is named after an exquisite and well-preserved round mosaic of the legendary hero Theseus locked 
    in combat with the Minotaur inside the Cretan Labyrinth. The villa itself occupies around 9600 square meters, with more than 1400 square meters of 
    mosaic pavement found thus far. Containing more than 100 rooms, this villa is the largest residential building on the island and among the largest 
    found in the Mediterranean. It belonged to the governor of Cyprus and is still being excavated today. </blockquote>

  <h2>Famous Artifact: Head from a Colossal Male Statue. Cypriot, Late 6th B.C.E.</h2>

  <div class = "container">
    <div class = "text">
    <blockquote>This head is associated with a large Egyptianizing statue that once stood within the Maratheri sanctuary complex. The life sized head used a mold that allowed for the inclusion of realistic details on the face. While the body for this piece has not been identified, its dimensions indicate that it was of substantial size. </blockquote>
