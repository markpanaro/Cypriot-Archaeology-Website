    <blockquote>This head is associated with a large Egyptianizing statue that once stood within the Maratheri sanctuary complex. The life sized head used a mold that allowed for the inclustion of realistic details on the face. While the body for this piece has not been identified, its dimensions indicate that it was of substantial size. </blockquote><br><br><br>
